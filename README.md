In this project, A-star based path planning approach is done on multiple robot dynamic configuration space using image processing from overhead camera. 
The planning is done in Remote PC that runs the ```path_planning.py``` file. The motor commands are sent to the mobile robots using Bluetooth. 
```Arduino_code.ino``` is the motor driving and bluetooth receiving code.
